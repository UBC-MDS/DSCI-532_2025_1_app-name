## Motivation and Purpose

## Description of the Data

## Research Questions and Usage Scenarios
Emily is a mother of a child with severe food allergies, including an egg allergy, and she wants to find highly rated cookie 
recipes that do not contain eggs. She wants to be able to [explore] the available recipes to [compare] different egg substitutes and [identify] the best-rated alternatives for her childâ€™s diet.

When Emily logs on to our app, she will see an overview of all the available cookie recipes, along with their ratings
and ingredient lists. She can filter out recipes containing eggs and explore alternative ingredients used in highly rated recipes. As she applies the filters, Emily may, for example, notice that "applesauce" and "flaxseed" are commonly used as egg substitutes, and that recipes using flaxseed tend to have higher ratings. This allows her to compare the effectiveness of different substitutes and make an informed decision about which recipes to try.

Based on her findings from using our app, Emily decides to try a highly rated egg-free cookie recipe that uses flaxseed. 
She saves the recipe for future reference and shares it with an allergy-friendly baking group to help others in similar situations.

## App Sketch & Brief Description

The app has a landing page that shows the distribution of cookie recipe ratings as a histogram and the
distribution of the different recipe ingredients as a bar chart.
The number of recipes and average recipe rating will also be displayed.
From the clickable boxes, the user can filter by overall category (basic or special ingredient).
They can filter even further by the ingredient subcategories (Flour, Sugar, Fats, Eggs, Chocolate, and Other) by clicking on the icons.
Additionally, they can filter by specific ingredient from the list of ingredients.
The list of ingredients will also display the popularity score of the ingredient.
There is also a slider that will allow the user to filter by their desired recipe rating range.
Also, there is a list of all of the recipes that match the filters, with their complexity score.
Users can hover over each recipe to see the full recipe and the ingredient proportions via a tooltip.
Alternatively, they can click on the recipe and there will be a pop-up with the full recipe and the ingredient proportions.
